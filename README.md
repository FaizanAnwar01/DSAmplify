# DSAmplify: Cultivating Knowledge, Fostering Collaboration 👩‍💻
📌Our aim is to build a website that comprehensively covers algorithms in C++, Java, Python, and other programming languages, along with acknowledging the contributors to this repository.
#### For that our to-do tasks are-
 1. Data Structures and algorithm programs implemented in C++ &amp; Java and other languagues.
 2. Making a html,css and javascript page to form a working website showing all the contributors and along with their contributions in this repository.
